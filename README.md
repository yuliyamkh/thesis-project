***Exploring the Effects of Population Size on Language Change: An Integrated Approach using Agent-Based Modeling and Statistical Analysis***

**Seminar für Sprachwissenschaft | Universität Tübingen**

**Abstract**

The effect of population size on language change has been the subject of a series of linguistic studies. However, the results of the studies vary, with some claiming that population size is a significant factor influencing language change, and others claiming that it is not. In this thesis, the relationship between population size and language change is investigated using a hybrid approach which integrates agent-based modeling and statistical analysis. The implemented agent-based model is a multi-speaker Moran model, and it is used to simulate language change under different conditions. The conditions are represented by the different mechanisms of language change: neutral change (drift), replicator selection, and interactor selection. The data generated by the multi-speaker Moran model are quantitatively analysed using multiple linear regression. The results of the statistical analysis show that population size significantly effects language change if selection is involved.
